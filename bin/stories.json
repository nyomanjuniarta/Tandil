Strangely enough, the first mayor of Tandil was from Denmark - you can see a statue of him in town if you look around. One of the buildings that remain as tribute to his passing is the Lutheran church in Tandil.\n\nLast year, el Templo Danés of Tandil commemorated it's 150 years of existence, and almost as if to celebrate it's passing of age, archeological investigations into the history of the religious establishment have uncovered unexpected relics of it's colorful past. An assortment of pipes with French inscriptions along with gin bottles and charred bones were discovered during a scientific study throughout 2017.\n\nThe church was believed to have been one of the entry/exit points of the numerous escape tunnels that were said to have spanned the area covered by the fort that stood in Tandil in the late 1800's.",

In the early 1900's it attracted much tourism to Tandil,  because of the way it was balanced on the edge of a hill. It fell and broke on February 29th, 1912. One theory for the cause of the fall was that the workers in Tandil's quarries at the time were annoyed with the tourist visits to the place. \n\nTourism can bring many advantages to a place, like economic boom but it may also bring on problems. Urban gentrification is one of them: when a low-visibility city or neighborhood suddenly attracts tourist attention, rents may increase and the local population may be forced to leave, in absence of affordable housing.",
